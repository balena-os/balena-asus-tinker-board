                Given that testbot devices use a tunnel to specific ports to communicate

                with the DUT that is established with the suite-generated keys, using

                a different keypair for the ssh-auth test would require to tear down and

                re-establish the tunnel.


                It's easier to just use the existing key pair in the ssh-auth test.

                Using two set of keys, the one created by the suite to authenticate by

                the proxy and a new custom key, is tricky as when running on testbot the

                key is used to establish the tunnel between core and DUT.


                Revert this change in preparation to removing the custom key and

                modifying the tests to use a single key.


                This reverts commit b24d92774a67cf0c0b83a29848bdcf6ed8a574db.

                chrony 4.2 introduces security hardening in the

                service definition that removes the CAP_SYS_ADMIN permission, affecting

                the way healthdog uses execve to become chronyd.


                commit 83f96efdfd2d (examples: harden systemd services)


                This commits works around it by allowing all members of the service's

                control group to send notification messages.

                The `os-config` application stops the supervisor before fetching openvpn

                configuration and starting the `openvpn` service unit.


                As the `openvpn` service units stops `os-config`, it might not get to

                restart the supervisor.


                This commit checks that `os-config` is not already active before

                starting it.


                Fixes #2855

                The sshd daemon is configured to fetch keys from the API for local

                user connections. The script that fetches the keys, cloud-public-sshkeys,

                sources balena-config-vars and is run as an exclusive non-root user.


                Let's set the correct permissions for this file to allow not to break

                the above.


                Also, add a test to check that the SSH authentication with user

                registered keys does not break again.


                Fixes #2785

                Yocto builds will abort due to inconsistencies between the pseudo

                database and files modified outside of the pseudo context [0].


                This will occasionally cause builds to fail in the do_deploy step of the

                kernel-devsrc recipe. [1]


                Fix this by not removing the kernel_source tarball in the do_deploy

                step.


                Fixes: https://github.com/balena-os/meta-balena/issues/2806

                The old test no longer matches on full disk paths including /dev, which

                can potentially result in the installation disk not being excluded from

                the pool of installation targets.


                Fix the comparison so that the installation disk will not be

                overwritten.

                This config file hasn't been used since commit 2db88c2, which unified

                how managed and unmanaged images operate. Since that commit, openvpn

                starts up if the config file at /etc/openvpn/openvpn.conf is found, and

                otherwise remains inactive. This file is populated by os-config.


                Remove the old config to prevent misdirection and cleanup the layer.

                Chronyd checks that the directory specified as `sourcedir` in
                `chrony.conf`

                (in this case `/var/chrony`) is not world accessible if it exists (chrony

                will create it correctly if it does not exist), and does not start

                if that's the case.


                The way that the `/var/chrony` is created when it does not exist opens

                the possibility of the directory existing with the wrong permissions and

                hitting this problem.


                This commit creates the directory with the correct permissions from the

                start to avoid the race condition.


                It also changes the permissiong from 750 to 770 to match what chrony

                does (see

                The task that applies the aufs patches is still required to support

                hostOS updates between aufs and overlay2 balenaOS versions.


                This commit adds support for 5.15 kernels and improves the branch

                selection logic to cover some corner cases.


                It also adds a test task so that we can test regressions.

                The move to include the ABI in the target definition was done in Poky:

                d6b563710e6cc0857843433d85023d47f9f2037d


                Without much explanation in the commit, the ABI was removed in Poky:

                e4c16d11128f0e9cc2567fc9e3579e9a94988b2e


                Only to be re-introduced, also without much explanation in Poky:

                0bf2fd16273436f1cd9ea2ab99ad882e879f965d


                Then, there was a partial revert to remove the ABI again in Poky:

                66ff1fb3a164fa794ee186960809e3fa9e938b48


                This last 66ff1fb3a164fa794ee186960809e3fa9e938b48 commit is reverted here as

                it fails to build for ARM targets. All our boards that cover all the

                possible ABIs build with this change.

                        The 243390 device specific tests assess that the hotspot
                        connection is created on the intended interface. We thus
                        need to ensure that the connection to the testbot is
                        established using the embedded wifi chip.

                        Unfortunately the standalone balena-cli package is linked to glibc

                        and does not work with musl (alpine) so we need to switch to debian.


                        The trade-off seems worth it for build times though.

                        publish the current setting.

                Instead of querying devices w/ `fdisk -l`, glob match patterns specified

                in resin-init-flasher.conf with devices present in `/dev`. This allows us to

                specify devices like `hd? sd? mmcblk?` instead of individual device

                numbers, which don't consistently map to any particular disk.


                This also allows RAID arrays to be matched with the array name and a

                pattern that glob matches even arrays assembled automatically on a

                non-matching host, such as `md/balena?(_?)` matching an array named

                `balena` and assembled on-device at `/dev/md/balena_0`.

                These packages also install kernel images into the boot directory in the

                root partition, overwriting the initramfs kernel installed by

                kernel-image-initramfs.


                Before kirkstone, the way to not include the kernel image was to

                override the `RDEPENDS:${KERNEL_PACKAGE_NAME}-base` not to include

                `kernel-image`, as was done in the `kernel-resin-noimage` class.


                Kirkstone changes the dependency from RDEPENDS to RRECOMMENDS in

                Poky's commit f6d963fa6d0e64d53f7ef56fd2c12d67f5811829


                Now excluding the kernel image needs to `PACKAGE_EXCLUDE = "kernel-image-*"`

                The latest meta-balena includes `util-linux-findmnt` as a kexec module

                dependency and this package has not yet been split from `util-linux` in

                below Zeus to 3.13.4, which is the minimum version to compile the rust

                The crate fetcher was introduced in bitbake in Kirkstone, before that

                it was living in meta-rust.


                We want to use the balena-rust layer across a wide variety of Yocto

                versions so include the fetcher conditionally.

                The arch_to_rust_arch() function was introduced to cater for ppc64le

                systems and is not present in older Yocto releases.


                This commit reverts to the previous way of setting the rust architecture.

                It will not work for ppc64le and if we would need to support such an

                architecture the arch_to_rust_arch() function will still be called if it

                exists in Kirkstone or newer Yocto versions.

                With Kirkstone and the support of openSSL 3.0 it's not possible to find

                a set of dependencies that work for all of our rust applications across

                the 1.32 to 1.62 toolchain versions that are supported across all the

                Yocto versions we keep compatibility with.


                This layer allows to set a preferred version as a distro setting that can

                be used across all Yocto versions.


                These rust recipes come from Poky Kirkstone

                For example, when we branch an ESR release, the meta-balena branch is

                tagged with the ESR name, like 2.83.x, while the last meta-balena version

                will be a proper semver.

                The balena-build.sh script accepts a token in the command line. This

                commit modifies the prepare-and-start.sh script to use it if

                available, and also modifies it to take into account the balena

                environment too.

                When fetching images for blocks, use a given release revision.


                Also, add token autentication to the API calls that miss it so that they work

                with private device types.


                Finally, fix indentation.

                When using the now deprecated release_version field, the API would

                reject deployments for an existing release.


                On the new versioning model, deployments increment a revision field so

                there is no need to check for uniqueness.

                BalenaCloud has now a release versioning feature that deprecates the

                use of release_version.


                Introduce a new balena_lib_release() function that utilises a balena

                contract and the CLI to set the release version.

                The previous commit moved the preloaded image out of yocto cache, which

                made it unreachable from the balena-generate-ami-env container.


                This patch makes mktemp create the file back within yocto cache to ensure

                this is shared yet still each concurrent process can safely have its own copy.

                Since the file name is hardcoded at this moment, this fails when two

                builds are running in parallel (e.g. dev and prod variants during deploy)

                because they try to preload the same file at pretty much the same moment.

                Having a separate copy for each outside of yocto cache should fix the issue.

                    - subject: Show warning instead of exception for invalid network config
                      hash: 5197a1330d69cbff97f3c53a77f640638e074b8a
                      body: >
                        A previous PR (#1656) fixed validation for network ipam config,

                        checking that both network and subnet are defined for each ipam config entry

                        (as described in the docker documentation).


                        After that PR, the validations throws an exception if the network target state is incorrect,

                        but this turns out to be the wrong approach, because that exception is also triggered

                        when querying target state.


                        This isn't a problem in normal operation, but it is in local mode, because local

                        mode queries the old target state before sending a new one. Since the query fails,

                        the CLI can never push the new target state.


                        This PR replaces the exception with a warning on the logs, since a

                        misconfigured network won't cause any engine failures, it will just

                        prevent containers to communicate through the provided network.


                        A future improvement should move this validation to an earlier point in the process,

                        so the target state can get rejected before it even gets to a point it

                        can be used.

                        The `start-resin-supervisor` script in newer OS version no longer uses the

                        SUPERVISOR_TAG environment variable setup on supervisor.conf and

                        update-supervisor.conf.


                        This change removes the need for that variable with livepush supervisor

                        to make it compatible with older and newer OS versions

                        'mz' can be safely replaced with fs.promises
                        and util.promisify for faster native methods.
                        'mkdirp' after Node v8 uses native fs.mkdir, thus
                        is redundant. 'body-parser' is deprecated and
                        contained within express v4.x.

                In order to verify GPG signature of grub.cfg it must be immutable.

                All the variables should be stored in grubenv file. This means

                bootcount, resin_root_part and upgrade_available variables need

                to be moved to grubenv.

                This brings in the aufs-to-overlay migrator. Which won't run until we

                configure the engine service to include an `BALENA_MIGRATE_OVERLAY=1`

                env var.


                The other notable change is the fix for

                https://github.com/balena-os/balena-engine/issues/236 which allows

                `balena top` to work as expected on balenaOS

                We need to make sure the modem is completely initialized before sending

                the AT commands that do the switch to ECM mode. To achieve this we

                change the systemd service dependency to depend on ModemManager.service

                and then we determine the modem state by using mmcli and querying the

                modem power-state property.


                This procedure will only be done once. After the modem is placed in ECM

                mode, it will stay in this mode for future reboots so there will be no

                other delays in bringing up the modem connection.

                Added a dependency on resin-state.service and resin-state-reset.service

                to etc-fake-hwclock.mount.


                On initial boot after flashing a device the resin-state-reset.service

                was running after etc-fake-hwclock.mount causing the bind mount point

                /mnt/state/root-overlay/etc/fake-hwclock to be deleted after it had

                been mounted. This resulted in a failure to save the date/time at

                shutdown which caused problems with persistent logging at next boot.

                Subsequent boots are unaffected as resin-state-reset does not run.

                Adding a dependency on the resin-state services ensures that the

                bind mount point is created after the state reset has been performed.


                This issue was noticed when running the testbot unmanaged OS image

                persistent logging test. When running a managed OS image the device

                normally reboots fairly immediately after connecting to the

                balena-cloud host and receiving parameter updates, so this issue is

                not usually noticeable.

                At this moment resin_update_state_probe is scanning pretty much every

                block device for rootfs. This include ramdisks, zram and loop devices

                which, when scanned, even spam warnings in logs. This patch updates

                the udev rule to skip such devices and only trigger on add or change

                events.

              hash: 7983e9bfd716aaedad1ef5f1468b2771e1f5a71c
              body: >
                Previously we were loading the healthcheck image from it's own service

                that was previously made `PartOf=` the balena.service.

                This was done in an attempt to help get the system unstuck when the

                image is removed (like through manual pruning), which would cause the

                healthcheck to trigger the engine to reboot until the load service was

                restarted by hand.


                Further investigation found a race between the first execution of the

                engine healthcheck script (which needs the image to be loaded) and the

                loader service itself, which would lead to a similar state, requireing

                manual intervention.


                This change moves the loading into the healthcheck script itself,

                allowing us to remove the loader script and service entirely, skipping

                the whole service ordering issue.

              hash: 5e1004d6753025166c40b11af117e008feb875f1
              body: >
                grub-efi requires modules to be installed in the boot partition, and

                resin-image installs them from ${DEPLOYDIR}.


                A normal grub installation installs those modules to ${PREFIX}/${libdir}

                to allow grub tooling to install them at runtime, but we're building the

                image with GRUB baked in, so we don't need those in the sysroot.


                The first iteration of this bbappend attempted to solve these

                constraints by copying the modules from ${D}/${libdir}/grub/ to

                ${DEPLOYDIR} in do_deploy(), then removing ${D}${prefix}. This had the

                unfortunate side effect of breaking the build in certain cases, such as

                clean builds or reexecuting do_deploy() without the other steps of the

                build.


                Instead, remove the unwanted files in do_install(), and append the

                required modules to GRUB_BUILDIN to create a standalone grub image

                without any external modules at all.

                as UUID=xxx the waiting loop in rootfs initrd script would assume UUIDs have

                just been regenerated and wait for a by-state symlink instead. This only works

                for the OS - flasher does not use the dynamically generated UUIDs

                therefore we always want to use the by-uuid link for it.

                Replace the 'bind-etc-fake-hwclock.service' with a systemd mount

                unit (etc-fake\x2dhwclock.mount).


                Using a systemd service to bind mount the /etc/fake-hwclock directory

                results in systemd generating an internal mount unit for the same

                directory. This causes problems at shutdown when both methods try to

                unmount the directory. This frequently leads to the directory being

                unmounted before the fake-hwclock service has managed to save the

                system time. This results in an inaccurate fake-hwclock time

                at next boot and corruption of the journal log.

                Add a dispatcher script to trigger the chrony online/offline

                re-run an iburst for sources when the appropriate network interface

                Fixes #2075


                Needed were a number of various changes to make the package compile properly:


                Removed is 0001-wwan-Set-MTU-based-on-what-ModemManager-exposes.patch that is now

                included upstream.


                Our patch for removing HTTPS connectivity checking warning is reworked for ease of

                maintainance. It now keeps the log entry, but changes it to debug level.


                Fixed are UPSTREAM_CHECK_* definitions as they referenced a wrong version number.


                The following additional configuration options were added/removed:


                *. Introspection is disabled through `--enable-introspection=no`. Other services do

                not depend on it, so it is safe to remove it. A related patch is no longer needed

                0002-Do-not-create-settings-settings-property-documentati.patch


                *. A new option for using firewalld zone for shared mode is disabled as we do not

                use firewalld.


                *. The polkit agent option no longer is available, so `--enable-polkit-agent` and

                `--disable-polkit-agent` are no longer defined.

              hash: 00556af37cf241e2b95d9b719f1ab58cc9bbddb6

                Replace busybox ps link with ps.procps without installing

                any other procps packages. This will avoid regression and bloat

                from swapping existing busybox links with procps variants.


                By using procps as docker expects we can properly handle ps args

                such as -e and -o to format output. Busybox is only capable of this

                when compiled in "desktop" mode.


                This upstream commit to poky has already split the ps binary into

                a separate procps package:


                - https://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/poky/commit/?id=507a47a4e5077d5f8f76d9629be6b871dfd8eb90


                So for now we can copy this recipe at the commit above into compat branches

                and use that version until we pick up a branch newer than gatesgarth.

                Fixes #1846


                UART modems (RaspberryPi HATs) are not working currently under

                balenaOS as NetworkManager times out while attempting to establish

                ppp connection. This is not a balenaOS specific issue.


                This commits adds a `connect ""` declaration to `/etc/ppp/options`

                to workaround this as the NULL default value causes the timeout.


                The connect option specifies an external script to establish the

                physical link. When using NetworkManager/ModemManager it is

                ModemManager that establishes the physical link before passing it

                to NetworkManager. Thus `connect` should be empty.

                This is necessary because node has its own built-in CA bundle and ignores

                container as well to keep the previous behavior. Make it read-only though,

                any modifications should be performed by the host OS.

                Remove the kernel-devsrc package from meta-balena and
                use the one from the upstream Poky project instead.

                Initially I hoped thud and warrior could also use the respective
                upstreams but I see several differences between the meta-balena
                version and the upstreams so I updated those compat layers
                as well.

                Update chrony from version 3.4 to version 4.0.

                The new version has enhancements and new features that will
                help to improve time synchronisation, including:

                - the ability to add server pools via scripts using chronyc.
                - support for dynamic NTP source files that can be reloaded
                  as necessary (useful for DHCP and config.json sources).
                - source name options for improved handling of pool addresses.
                - repeat 'iburst' when a source is changed from offline to
                  online state.

                returns to its original place, and these hooks copy the old database to the

                new location to avoid data loss.

                We have no use for u-boot-initial-env and enabling it would require

                additional changes in do_compile to match the commit linked above.

                Ensure that the /var/log/supervisor-log directory exists prior to

                running 'balena start --attach resin_supervisor' as well as

                'runSupervisor'.


                Updates to the 'start-resin-supervisor' script in v2.62.1 removed

                the check for updates to the REGISTRY_ENDPOINT variable. Previously

                this had been detected as changing every time the script was run

                due to a comparison between 'null' and ''. This resulted in the

                'start-resin-supervisor' script always running through the

                'runSupervisor' path. With this variable check removed, and no config

                updates being detected, the script was trying to run

                'balena start --attach resin_supervisor' and failing due to the

                absence of the /var/log/supervisor-log directory. To fix this problem we

                unconditionally test for and create this directory (if necessary) so

                that it is available regardless of the path taken through the script.

                Change the chrony UDP source port from 123 (privileged) to

                1234 (non-privileged).


                Previous issues with Phicomm routers had required the use of a fixed

                UDP source port, so port 123 was chosen as this is used by both ntpd

                and ntpdate. However recent testing has shown that using a privileged

                port such as 123 can cause issues on other networks. By changing the

                port to be non-privileged (i.e. 1234) we can satisfy both network

                requirements.

              hash: 1c1374f3c8b5914b7e645f8068ebafc8b4cbbe3a
              body: >
                The handling of the RTC at boot time has been improved as follows:


                1) A 'timeinit-rtc.sh' script has been added to improve logging of
                   system time updates from the RTC and to prevent system time
                   being set when RTC time is behind system time. If RTC time is
                   found to be behind system time a warning is issued regarding
                   potential RTC battery failure.

                2) The 'timeinit-rtc.service' has been added to the new systemd
                   'time-set.target'. This allows for better control and
                   co-ordination between the various time source services.

                3) Systemd dependencies have been updated to ensure that the
                   RTC is the final time service before the 'time-set.target'
                   is reached.

                The 'timeinit-buildtime.sh' script has been updated to use the

                new support functions provided by the 'os-helpers-time' script.

                        A docker-compose.yml with the following structure


                        ```

                        version: '2.1'

                        services:
                          app_1:
                            build: ./noisy-1
                            image: noisy1
                          app_2:
                            build: ./noisy-1
                            image: noisy1
                          app_3:
                            build: ./noisy-1
                            image: noisy1
                        ```


                        Will lead to the supervisor creating multiple image database entries

                        with the same dockerId (this is because of how the engine handles this

                        particular case). This case is not handled by the removal process

                        leading to image pile up and increased disk usage.

                        The memory information reported by the supervisor currently

                        estimates the value of used memory as `MemTotal - MemFree`.

                        However, linux systems will try to cache and buffer as much

                        memory as possible, which will affect the output of `MemFree`

                        (from /proc/meminfo) and in consequence the memory usage seen

                        by the user on the dashboard, which will appear much greater than

                        it is.


                        The correct calculation should be `MemTotal - MemFree - Buffers - Cached`,

                        which the calculation performed by `htop` and the `free` commands.

                        Due to the singleton work, when performing migration M00005 and there

                        are apps with services created in the database, a deadlock occurs

                        during database initialization due to a circular

                        dependency for generating scoped keys.

                        When trying to apply SSDT overlays in Up Board, the supervisor currently

                        gets stuck in a loop trying to apply target state. See #1465


                        This was due to a bug in parsing the configuration, which lead to

                        the method bootConfigChangeRequired returning true when no change was

                        needed.

                        Each service, when requesting access to the Supervisor API, will

                        now get an individual key which can be scoped to specific resources.

                        In this iteration the default scope will be to the application that

                        the service belongs to.


                        We also have a `global` scope which is used by the cloud API when in

                        managed mode.

                By default chrony uses a random UDP source port for each NTP request.

                This can cause problems with particular routers/firewalls (issues have

                been reported for the Phicomm KE 2P).


                The chrony `acquisitionport` configuration setting has been added

                to the chrony.conf file to change the UDP source port for NTP requests

                to 123 (this is the same as the default source port used by both

                ntpdate and ntpd).

                Drop the '-s' command line parameter from chronyd as:

                a) restoring time from the drift file is no longer necessary due to

                the fake-hwclock service, and

                b) restoring time from the RTC is already covered by the timeinit-rtc

                service.

              body: >
                In order to produce sensible timestamps for journald log messages:

                a) the system time needs to be maintained correctly over a reboot, and

                b) the system time needs to be set before journald is started.


                Currently the system time is maintained over reboots on systems

                without an RTC using the last modified time of the chrony drift file.

                However there are a couple of issues with this approach:


                a) /var/lib/chrony/ is not mounted early enough in the boot process

                to be available for setting the time before journald is started.

                b) there is an issue with the current systemd dependencies that result

                in the last modified time of the drift file not being updated when the

                system is shutdown or rebooted (see #1995).


                The Debian fake-hwclock service (as used by Raspberry Pi OS) has been

                added to overcome these issues.


                The fake-hwclock service will save and restore the system time from

                the fake-hwclock.data file (in /etc/fake-hwclock/). The system time

                is loaded from this file at boot and saved to it on shutdown. An

                additional timer service has been added to update the file on an

                hourly basis to cater for unexpected shutdown scenarios, e.g. power

                failure.


                The timeinit-timestamp service has improved logging and has been

                renamed to timeinit-buildtime for clarity.


                A new time-set.target has been added as per upstream systemd and

                the fake-hwclock and timeinit-buildtime services have been added

                to it.

                The list of hostapp extensions to install can either be passed to the

                in that order.

                Host extension images contain extra content that is overlayed over the

                root filesystem at boot.


                This commits adds the default host extensions to the data partition

                image, stores their repository tags in the /etc directory, and creates

                the containers so that mobynit can mount the container filesystems on

                boot.

                This only applies to the host configuration files which are the only ones

                If the rootfs is on a slow-to-bring-up device (e.g. RPi4 + USB)

                the fsuuidsinit_enabled() function may return before the balena symlinks

                are created. This gets wrongly interpreted as missing UUIDs leading to

                a chain of failures in the subsequent scripts.

                This patch moves the symlink waiting loop from fsuuidsinit_run()

                to fsuuids_enabled() before the first usage of the symlink.

                        Due to switching to Alpine the ability to resolve mDNS
                        hostnames was lost. This patch overrides the lookup and
                        manually resolves the names.

                                failures when pulling from private registries, and library users may

                                have to adapt.

                                        This is a hack, and should be reverted once we get to the bottom of it.

                                        It will impact performance, but right now there are things that should

                                        be filtered and are not, so lets get this merged for security purposes.

                                        Hopefully this library will be re-written soon.

                                Handlebars supports very basic if condition checking, but it only checks
                                for

                                existence of a field. There are times when we want to combine conditions in order

                                to generate something as part of a blueprint, without defining a completely separate

                                blueprint for it (like generating network config schema if a dt has a wifi chip or

                                a usb port to which we can connect a dongle).

                In b791055f3f6ffd6cc5796569a7321c5060129eea I attempted to have flasher

                images report their preconfigured supervisor version without a good

                understanding of how flasher images work. As it turns out no supervisor

                information is maintained in the flasher image itself, so until that is

                sorted stop reporting a blank string for the supervisor version.

                Recently the supervisor added a codepath that assumes no files underneath
                it will change during runtime.

                OS update hooks can trigger a condition whereby the supervisor reboots the device during a HUP,

                which in turn bricks the device.


                Additionally, since unknown args cause this update to fail-closed,

                remove that barrier to future-proof more flag expansion.

                On commit a4ce26caadabcb1e87d944d78218cc32c579914e the supervisor moved

                from using --volume to using --mount to avoid the implicit creation of

                directories instead of files.


                However, in the case where the mount referred to a directory, these have

                to exist in the rootfs beforehand as --mount will not create them.


                This commit checks for the existence of the /var/log/supervisor-log

                directory and creates it if required.

                In rocko, systemd kills any script started in background,
                same thing happening to children that get re-parented.

                One solution to this is to use a separate service file for
                starting the healtcheck image load script, after balena.service
                was started.

                Otherwise, as util-linux has a higher default alternative priority, the

                version in util-linux is chosen. It would seem they are exchangeable, but

                the busybox version reportedly works even if the RTC interrupt line is not

                connected.

                initial supervisor_version metadata. This connects back to tri-app.

                On commit a4ce26caadabcb1e87d944d78218cc32c579914e the supervisor moved

                from using --volume to using --mount to avoid the implicit creation of

                directories instead of files.


                However, in the case where the mount referred to a directory, these have

                to exist in the rootfs beforehand as --mount will not create them.


                This commit checks for the existence of the /resin-data/resin-supervisor

                directory and creates it if required.

                When performing hostOS updates, the resin-logo.png might have

                been customized by the customer.

                This commits renames it to the newly branded balena-logo.png


                If the resin-logo.png was unmodified, it will forcefully replace to

                balena-logo.png to force rebranding of older resin branded release.

                The `docker` Docker Hub repository lists what versions of the image

                are supported and 18.6 is not among them at all. Use the current stable

                line of 18.09 instead, to stay on supported versions. See more info at:

                https://hub.docker.com/_/docker


                For more reproducability, we are also including the patch level version

                of the container, which will give us more responsibility to update more

                frequently, but fewer surprises.


                Also explicitly set `DOCKER_HOST` for the daemon being started, otherwise

                the base image's setting might silently take over, and modify this.


                Replace deprecated `-g` (graph driver) with `--data-root` as well.

                resin-init has a hardcoded command to disable power management

                on wlan0. This commit moves the logic to udev rule as there is

                no guarantee wlan0 is the only or default wlan adapter in the system.


                There seems to be no better way to identify a wlan device in udev

                than KERNEL=="wl*" which should match both net.ifnames=0 (wlanX)

                and net.ifnames=1 (wlpX).

                        The host config variable HOST_DISCOVERABILITY can be set to

                        true or false, controlling the state of the avahi service. This

                        determines if the device advertises it's presence over mDNS.

                        Controlled by BALENA_HOST_FIREWALL_MODE, the firewall can

                        either be 'on' or 'off'.


                        - In the 'off' state, all traffic is allowed.

                        - In the 'on' state, only traffic for the core services provided
                          by Balena is allowed.

                        In the absence of an upstream implementation of the DeviceRequest API
                        introduced

                        as part of Docker API v1.40 we roll our own using a feature label.


                        As per my comment in the code, we fall back to the default behavior of

                        docker cli's `--gpu` and request single device with the `gpu` capabilty.

                        The only implementation at the moment is the NVIDIA driver; here:

                        https://github.com/balena-os/balena-engine/blob/master/daemon/nvidia_linux.go

                        This is part of the work to make the application-manager module much

                        less monolithic, in preperation for system apps and more generally

                        multi-app.

                        We were treating the database class as a singleton, but still having to
                        pass

                        around the db instance. Now we can simply require the db module and have

                        access to the database handle.

                This enables a compressed RAM swap of 25% of total system memory or 1GB,

                whichever smallest.


                Upstream Yocto has a zram implementation that's broken in warrior, and a

                new implementation introduced in Zeus that does not work in BalenaOS as

                we run two udevs, one in the initramfs and one in the main OS. The

                mkswap needs to happen in the initramfs udev otherwise the udev database

                is not updated with the swap device and the zram0 device is not detected

                by systemd.


                This implementation is simpler than the one upstream and common to all

                the supported Yocto versions. It uses a udev rule in the initramfs that

                creates the swap drive, and a swap unit in the main OS that enables it.

              body: >
                When the user supplies an additional NTP server source which is a

                pool URL the 'burst' command may fail. This occurs when the pool

                URL resolves to a different IP addresses for the 'add server' and

                'burst' commands.


                To avoid this issue we can combine the burst functionality into the

                'add server' command by using the 'iburst' option. Although this

                option is not documented by the chronyc man page it has been present

                since v1.25 released in 2011.


                This fix has been tested via the balenaOS (2.51.1+rev1) command line

                running on a RPi3.

                The dependency is introduced by the upstream.sh and downstream.sh scripts.

                Bash is also a dependency not only for internal packages but for external

                scripts too.

                From v2.49, the hostapp-update utility creates the /run directory in the

                root filesystem, however when huping from previous versions /run is not there.


                This commit switches to use /tmp to store the new UUID for the root partition on

                first boot after generating new UUIDs.

                rust is used for various utilities in the OS.

                e.g. os-config, healthdog, bindmount, some others maybe


                At the moment, we haven't syncronized on one rust version and device

                integration layers can pick any meta-rust version. Which probably uses

                the latest rust version in the layer.


                Lets sync on 1.36 and move in steps when needed.

                The power save has been switched from 'off' to 'on' in adf69fb
                with no apparent motivation, we consider it an oversight
                and the desired state is 'off'.

                Fixes #1850

                        This allows a response to an input with dport=`supevisor api port` and

                        is required when the host OS is doing stateful firewalling.


                        This should not affect things when stateful firewalling is not in

                        effect, as the standard OUTPUT chain policy is ACCEPT, so we're just

                        being explicit about it.

                        We move the old sync.js script to tools/, and delete the now-broken

                        sync-debug.js.


                        We add a command `npm run sync`, which starts a livepush process

                        with the supervisor on a device.

                        We also remove the Makefile to go to a simpler build system, as long with

                        the retry_docker_push.sh file. We remove the rest of the automation tools

                        as they're no longer used and update the circle.yml file.


                        We also remove debug builds, as these aren't needed moving forward, and were

                        only to enable livepush builds.

              body: >
                When a partition filesystem label is detected, udev checks whether the

                device belongs to the same disk as the root partitition passed in the

                kernel command line by the bootloader. Only if it does, it creates a by-state

                link to it.


                By using this by-state links we avoid filesystem label clashes as the

                system will always use partitions in the same drive as root (as

                instructed by the bootloader who is the source of truth).

            - subject: Switch to built-in FAT kernel configs
              hash: d892362e92f8af709aa000dfb328f2931aedfb85
              body: >
                balenaOS uses FAT as a fs type for the boot/first partition. This is

                currently hardcoded so let's have the related kernel configs built in

                the kernel image. In this way we don't have to handle kernel modules in

                the initramfs (when needed).

                Lets pass it here to keep it correct.


                Should not have any actual affect. NM plugin was built with reference

                to the 2.4.7 headers. Just the directoy path would say 2.4.5 misleading

                We also delete the patch that switched the 12d1:1f01 modems to
                NCM mode with that specific MessageContent because that made
                other Huawei modems that used the same vid:pid combination
                unusable in that mode. So now these modems will work in the old
                Hilink mode using cdc_ether instead.

                Some devices have special tools in the initramfs that bloat it.

                e.g. Jetson family have tegra-firmware-xusb etc.


                IMAGE_ROOTFS_MAXSIZE triggers an error if the rootfs goes beyond this

                limit. This does not force the rootfs to an empty fixed size.


                We can comfortably increase the max size to 32MB to reduce unnecessary

                patches in the device integration layers.


                We'll still be covered by the full resin-rootA size limit.

              body: >
                The DNS clients (applications) resolver libraries use the timeout value in

                /etc/resolv.conf to set the time between DNS attempts. The default is 5

                secs which for slow networks like cellular mean lots of DNS requests on

                a bandwidth sensitive channel.


                This change modifies the default to 15 secs. This timeout only applies

                when DNS servers are unresponsive so it will not affect the normal

                functionality.

                This commit increases the default NTP poll rate to around 4.5 hours.


                BalenaOS uses chronyd for time synchronization, and it allows to specify

                a minpoll and maxpoll values per server with a power of two number of

                seconds for the minimum and maximum polling time respectively.


                With those constraints, the change set both limits to 2^14s (4.55h) for

                all servers.


                An architectural decision has been made not to make this configurable.


                Fixes #1780.

                Fixes #1775

                Removed the two patches we included in favor of corresponding
                configure arguments since they had to be updated anyway.

              hash: 4b50d967db309366865b791e39f84ab00c0e9330
              body: |
                It is better to use fdisk to check that an internal media
                is a suitable block device rather than using the shell
                internal block testing feature. This is because there is
                at least a case when the kernel lists an ASMT 2115 controller
                as /dev/sda but that is not an actual drive so it cannot be
                written to and the flashing procedure will error out.

                Reports indicate that NetworkManager can leave stale temporary files on

                the state partition that over time can affect the device's operability.


                This commit removes the timestamps.XXXXXX and seen-bssids.XXXXXX files on

                startup to avoid this situation.

              hash: 3004762e71383e6ed8134de526966c6dd660fca2
              body: >
                We inherit do_populate_lic_deploy from poky. It uses IMAGE_NAME

                which includes DATETIME


                DATETIME changes between runs so we can sometimes get into a state

                where the do_populate_lic_deploy task has its stamp file set.


                But when our subsequent deploy_image_license_manifest task runs, the

                DATETIME is different. Hence we get into a state where we have to

                run cleanall on the resin-image-flasher recipe to clean up directories.


                Lets mark do_populate_lic_deploy with nostamp. This should make it

                run every time we need to run deploy_image_license_manifest with the

                most up to date DATETIME variable to prevent any hiccups

                Need to make the script go in the background in ExecStartPost=.

                Otherwise, the service status never gets to active/running resulting

                it in remaining stuck in an endless loop.


                If the health-check load fails for whatever reason, the subsequent

                engine healthcheck will fail retriggering the healthcheck load.

                udev initialization.

                Customers usually don't need this delay during u-boot. Also in some

                cases, hardware attached on the uart pins might pause uboot preventing

                customers from using dev images easily.


                But we do need this delay during our development work on bsps etc.


                Lets make this autoboot delay build time configurable


                Also make the BOOTDELAY -2 which is better than 0 as that completely

                prevents any char on serial from interrupting boot.

                We would just check for the existence of console=null in kernel cmdline


                A better way would be to check the presence of a valid symlink for fd0,

                fd1 and fd2. And assign them to /dev/null if unavailable.

                The default driver is cgroupfs. We switch to systemd so that there is

                one cgroup manager in our OS.


                Otherwise, systemd will have its own cgroup manager and cgroupfs will

                be another cgroup manager via balenaEngine daemon.

                PR #1441 changed mnt-sysroot-inactive to an automount. But there is no

                way to easily add a udev dependency to the automount. As a result,

                when rollbacks tries to access the inactive partition, it fails.

                Let's add systemd-udev-settle.service to the rollback services.


                This will only delay the first boot after a HUP which is reasonable.

                After a HUP, until rollbacks clears its state, the supervisor(or user)

                can trigger good reboots. These reboots might be seen by the bootloader

                as bad reboots.


                To prevent this from happening, add a service that clears the bootcount

                upon good reboots. This only runs if the rollback services have not

                cleared their flag files in the state partition.

            - subject: Devices using u-boot. Enable rollback-altboot by handling bootcount via
                meta-balena.
              hash: aa0a389ea92a71123813f291833fea61f4965164
              body: >
                U-boot has its own bootcount framework. However, that will require

                handling in each device type. We will use u-boot shell commands

                env import -t, env export -t, fatload, fatwrite

                to read/write/increment bootcount in env_resin.h.


                This will allow us to scale to lots of devices.


                A flag os_bootcount_skip is left for devices that are unable to support

                fatwrite in u-boot (in some rare cases). This will allow a device to

                not support rollback-altboot and still function.


                This patch requires that CMD_SETEXPR be enabled in u-boot config

                options.

            - subject: Production Devices using u-boot. Enable CONFIG_RESET_TO_RETRY to reset
                a device in case it drops into a u-boot shell
              hash: 1f7ead33c284f4dc8e2a3d78b2a922a9b778e05c

                We'd like to enable some options in all boards header files via

                meta-balena. This patch adds a task to include config_resin.h into

                config_default.h (which is included in all board header files).

                We can then add a config option via meta-balena that will be enabled for

                all devices.


                This patch enables CONFIG_RESET_TO_RETRY. If for whatever strange reason

                (accidental fs issue in u-boot etc), this will trigger a u-boot reset

                command the device in 15 seconds.


                Note This requires that the device's u-boot supports the reset command

                which it probably should.

                Occasionally balena ps and balena info work but the balena daemon is

                unable to start a new container. This is usually when something in runc

                or containerd is not functioning correctly.


                Add a healthcheck to spin up a simple hello-world container as well.


                The trade-off here is that there will be a few extra writes to disk

                every healthcheck timeout. But there will be a benefit that if runc

                or containerd is in a bad state, the healthcheck will fail and systemd

                will restart the balena daemon to recover the application container

                The data partition contains the supervisor which is only about 61M on

                zeros. But lets reduce the size of the data partition to eat less

                space whenever an uncompressed image is used anywhere. e.g. when

                extracting the zip to dd or using balena-migrate etc.


                The partition expands on first boot to fill the rest of the disk

                anyways.

                Fixes #1564


                This bbclass uses the common layer path advertised by BBLAYERS to find

                the paths to different resources in board repository. For example

                machine json - to get the slug and advertise it in os-release. After

                renaming the common layer (resin to balena) and because we support old

                references to the old common layer name (by including a dummy

                deprecation layer), we need to make sure this class can cope now with

                both cases.

                Poky, following os-release(5), sanitizes VERSION_ID accordingly but in

                doing so it produces a nonisemver compliant version. For example:

                    VERSION="2.37.0+rev1"
                    VERSION_ID="2.37.0-rev1"

                This patch reverts that to make sure rev is a build tag.

                This change backports a PR[1] that is already in systemd and will come

                included by default from the version in Yocto warrior.


                In summary, with this change we fix newer NM which stopped handling

                rp_filter when connected to multiple interfaces. See "device: disable

                rp_filter handling" commit from NM. Without this change, only the

                default route will me usable and binding to a specific interface will

                break connectivity if that interface is not also the default route for

                the target IP.

                Currently, bluez's storage data is set to /var/lib/bluetooth which

                in turn is a tmpfs location. We want this location persistent so we can

                save paired devices over reboot. We do that by adding the corresponding

                bind mount to the state partition and setting bluez to depend on this

                mount unit.

                VERSION and VERSION_ID had a slightly different semantics in balenaOS.

                VERSION was referring to the BalenaOS (host OS) version (which is coming from

                device repositories) while VERSION_ID was set to the DISTRO_VERSION.

                This brings confusion so we change it to adhere to

              body: >
                Since 1.29, busybox switched to an internal implementation of the

                resolver based on a feature config, NSLOOKUP_BIG. This is enabled by

                default and it's meant to be musl compatible. In BalenaOS we use glibc

                and we rely on it for being able to resolve names using NSS modules

                (libmdns).

                This adds an easier to debug logging that shows both removed and kept

                firmwares. For example:

                 Cleaning iwlwifi firmware version 8000C to minimum API version 34.
                   Removing iwlwifi-8000C-13.ucode.
                   Removing iwlwifi-8000C-22.ucode.
                   Removing iwlwifi-8000C-21.ucode.
                   Removing iwlwifi-8000C-31.ucode.
                   Removing iwlwifi-8000C-16.ucode.
                   Removing iwlwifi-8000C-27.ucode.
                   Leaving iwlwifi-8000C-34.ucode in place.
                   Leaving iwlwifi-8000C-36.ucode in place.

                Also, this commit improves the version comparison which was comparing

                strings and not integers. Now we try integer comparison and fallback to

                string when parse fails.


                Finally, the task's vardeps expands varflags to correctly retrigger on

                change.

                This adds set_os_cmdline which defines os_cmdline so that BSPs can

                import it in their bootargs and pass it to kernel accordingly. Also, as

                part of os_cmdline, there is an argument added when the booted image is

                a flasher. This can be used in the OS for various flasher specific

                checks.

                Since yocto thud, and more specifically since poky switched to

                openssl 1.1 line, the openssl binary is provided by 'openssl-bin'. On

                that version, 'openssl' doesn't provide this binary making the uuid

                generation script fail.


                This patch makes 'openssl-bin' the default dependency but does that in a

                way that older yocto versions can overwrite it back to the old provider

                (openssl package).

                Any error messages or warnings printed here are invisible in production

                images. This line from debian initramfs-tools configures the initramfs

                shell to log all output in /dev/kmsg so the dmesg shows the output of

              hash: b7a6412e6368d3d562ff1ca2fb06be92a24a8548
              body: >
                When we set the udev rule we use IMPORT{program} to know what symlinks

                to create in the sysroot directory. The problem is that we don't use

                absolute paths and from the documentation udev uses /usr/lib/udev as the

                default path while we install the invoked script in /lib/udev.


                ```
                  Execute an external program specified as the assigned value. If no
                  absolute path is given, the program is expected to live in
                  /usr/lib/udev; otherwise, the absolute path must be specified.
                ```


                This PR changes the udev rule to use an absolute path for the

                resin_update_state_probe script. Also it fixes some typos in the script

                itself.

              hash: 9571c572e4abcd1ea5951fa408b1543bc40db8c9
              body: >
                Since thud, poky distro file on which balena OS is based, already

                includes security_flags.inc. Because of this change, this version throws

                a build warning similar to:


                WARNING Duplicate inclusion for /build/../layers/poky/meta/conf/distro/include/security_flags.inc

                in /build/../layers/meta-resin/meta-balena-thud/conf/distro/include/balena-os-yocto-version.inc


                This happens because again, we import `poky` and `security_flags` but

                since thud, poky includes security_flags by default. In order to avoid

                this warning we import it (security_flags) now using an .inc file at the

                level of the yocto version meta-balena layer. There is as well a small

                additional wrinkle here. We switch the include statement from `require`

                to `include` so new layers (like thud) don't have to carry this hack in

                the future.


                This commit prepares meta-balena for thud support.

                devtool moves the files from the WORKDIR into ${S}/oe-local-files which
                makes

                copying of env_resin.h fail if the u-boot source is being modified using

                devtool. Since devtool also alters FILESPATH to include said oe-local-files

                directory, we can iterate over those paths instead of relying on WORKDIR.

                balenaOS comes in two flavours, production/development. production

                images have various options passed to the kernel cmdline.

                Currently some devices BSPs have those options passed and some dont.

                It'll be hard to keep the common options consistent.

                e.g. consoleblank=0 is passed for some devices and not for others.


                We'd like the extra options we pass to be in one place. All BSPs can

                then append this variable in their respective recipe/bootloader config

                etc.

                e2fsck by default checks differences between the system time and the

                last filesystem mount timestamp.


                As we run on devices without an rtc, and we run the filesystem-expand

                service which runs fsck before ntp sync happens, this results in errors

                like


                Superblock last mount time (Thu Mar 14 17:13:02 2019,
                      now = Mon Mar 11 15:29:56 2019) is in the future.
                Fix? yes


                This results in fsck running on the data partition on every boot which

                slows down the boot time.


                Add e2fsck.conf file with the broken_system_clock flag to prevent this

                check from running fsck on every boot. Quite a few distros do this as

                well.

                Currently mmc and usb devices are checked at every boot for the presence

                of flasher images. USB initialization is slow 1-3 seconds. This slows

                boot time significantly.


                Most device types dont need to check for the presence of flasher images

                in usb devies. Modify u-boot to only check for mmc devices.


                usb initialization happens in devices via the "usb start" command. This

                is usually configured in CONFIG_PREBOOT for devices. Devices will need

                to remove "usb start" from CONFIG_PREBOOT to benefit from any boot time

                optimization.


                We will need to run "usb start" ourselves via env_resin for any device

                that happens to be searching for flasher images in usb device types.

                Currently, because we bind mount apps.json unconditionally, when this

                file doesn't exist, balena engine will create a directory on the data

                filesystem. This breaks when we add an apps.json file after the

                supervisor container was already created.

                Under the current configuration we instruct NetworkManager through its

                configuration to completely ignore all the tun devices. This was

                enforced as an extra precation as we run an openvpn client which

                connects to the balena-cloud backend. This client creates, on the host,

                the interface `resin-tun` currently (rename pending). We want to loosen

                up this restriction to only unmanage this specific device - `resin-tun`

                - so that users can take advantage of NetworkManager managing other tun

                devices.

              body: >
                63baa421 introduced a bug where the tools in the header tarballs were

                compiled with the incorrect HOSTCC parameter. As a result the tools

                inside the tarball were compiled for x86-64 instead of the native

                device architecture. And they had the incorrect ld interpreter path

                as well.


                Update to v0.0.12 to fix that.

                This release also adds objtool support needed by the intel nuc image.

                The bbappend uses a local `resin-files` directory for additional file

                subdirectory will be used by default. The problem shows when the recipe

                is not in the same directoy as bitbake will not be able to find needed

                bbappended files.

        In meta-balena, arch checks have been added to all binaries going in the
        kernel-modules-headers tarball. These binaries are inherited from the
        kernel git tree. They are compiled for x86 and trigger QA arch errors.
        Remove them from the package. They are still included in the tarball.
        Just removed from the package infrastructure. We don't use the ipk
        file for anything other than QA checks

                As part of resin rename to balena, we rename the distro file including

                the OS name which is part of the distro name. This ends up in the

                The original 60s might be slow for some devices where balena
                is busy with a task and the hardware is slow for various
                reasons (ie. Pi1/Zero). In those cases even if the device
                is functioning correctly, the healthcheck will assess the
                device as unhealthy and restart balena and/or the supervisor.

                This patch adds support for translating SSH public keys from config.json

                to an authorize_keys file. We use `authorize_keys_local` file as the

                destination file of this translation so we can differentiate in between keys

                brought locally from config.json and keys brought from the balena backend

                through os-config an avoid racing issues with this tool (os-config). The final

                `authorize_keys` file will be merged at every ssh connection in the dropbear

                service.


                These SSH custom public keys in config.json are assumed to be provided

                as an array in `.os.sshKeys`. Example:

                {
                  [...]
                  "os": {
                    "sshKeys": [
                      "ssh-rsa ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ",
                      "ssh-rsa 0123456789"
                    ]
                  },
                  [...]
                }

                option

              body: |
                This patch replaces the "Client identifier" option from
                DHCP packets sent by NM to resemble the way udhcpc does it.

                The reason is that the Cisco RV325 router with fw older than
                v1.2.1.14 doesn't reply to DHCP requests or discovery packages
                if the "Client identifier" option is formatted in NM's style.

                Even though this is a bug in the router's fw, we are going to
                fix it here because we encountered clients that couldn't get
                an IP address on these routers and we want to avoid that

                os-udevrules will parse config.json for any udev rules and copy the

                rules in /etc/udev/rules.d/key.rules


                udev rules can be passed via config.json in the following format

                  "settings": {
                    "udevrules": {
                      "60": "single line. Remember to escape the double quotes",
                      "99": "multi line \n2nd line"
                   }
                 }

                The above snippet will appear as /etc/udev/rules.d/60.rules

                and /etc/udev/rules.d/99.rules


                The first time rules are added/modified, these rules will be added and

                udevd will be asked to reload rules and re-trigger.

                This patch bumps the balena version in meta-resin.


                The update in balena adds support to pass an argument to mobynit which

                allows mobynit to mount a rootfs from a custom path.


                The command ./mobynit -sysroot /mnt/sysroot/inactive will mount the

                rootfs partition from /mnt/sysroot/inactive and return the destination

                path in stdout.

            - subject: Fix proxy when using containers over bridge network
              hash: 3df6e1906e1138a8cd10d15ac3008685b90f75f8
              body: >
                Before multicontainer support in resin, the user container was running

                over the host's network stack which means that all the packets were

                treated as locally emitted ones. In this case, the communication was

                redirected as per the OUTPUT iptable rule only.

                In the "multicontainer world" the user containers run on top of bridge

                network which makes the host act as a socksifying router. In this case,

                the packets won't go through the OUTPUT chain and the redirection to

                redsocks needs to happen at PREROUTING chain.

                This change adds a redirect rule at PREROUTING for TCP packets to

                redsocks to redirect packets from the containers to redsocks too.


                As well, this adds support for redirecting DNS UDP packets to redsocks.

                This is implemented as iptables rules which are only added if the

                redsocks configuration has a `dnsu2t` section.

                We would like resin-altboot service to run before balena starts

                resin-altboot checks if the boot configuration is set to run

                resinOS from rootA(B) but we are actually running rootB(A) due to

                something.


                If rollback-altboot triggers, it will run hooks to refresh boot files

                and reboot. There is no point starting balena in such a device state

                as that will only slow down the hooks from running.

                This recipe adds a few systemd services and scripts that handle

                automated OS rollback functionality.


                The rollback-altboot.service checks if we are running in altboot mode

                i.e. resinOS_uEnv.txt says we should boot resin_root_part=3. But we are

                actually running resinOS from resin_root_part=2. This can happen if

                a reboot happened without clearing upgrade_available in resinOS_uEnv

                txt file. A kernel panic happened etc.


                The rollback-altboot script runs hostapp-update hooks to change the

                bootfiles.


                The rollback-health.service runs rollback-health which checks if vpn is

                online and balena is healthy after a hostapp-update.

                This patch adds a simple check in env_resin.h.


                If bootcount is found to be greater than bootlimit, switch the

                partitions. Both bootcount and bootlimit are standard u-boot env

                variables.


                To enable rollback in devices, devices have to do the following in

                their u-boot


                Enable CONFIG_CMD_SETEXPR, CONFIG_BOOTCOUNT_LIMIT and depending on the

                device, save the bootcount in some persistant location whether that

                is an area in the SoC or an ext partition etc.


                If you are using the CONFIG_BOOTCOUNT_EXT driver, use only the boot

                partition and use the filename "bootcount.env"


                E.g. for rpi3

                CONFIG_CMD_SETEXPR=y

                CONFIG_BOOTCOUNT_LIMIT=y

                CONFIG_SYS_BOOTCOUNT_ADDR=0x02300000

                CONFIG_BOOTCOUNT_EXT=y

                CONFIG_SYS_BOOTCOUNT_EXT_DEVPART=0:1

                CONFIG_SYS_BOOTCOUNT_EXT_NAME="bootcount.env"

                Devices that support automated os rollbacks will have two extra

                Otherwise stick to the previous way of updating grub.cfg


                For devices using grub 2.0, devices will have to mirror the pattern

                that exists in u-boot.

                i.e.
                 Add a variable upgrade_available to grub.cfg (HUP hooks update this)
                 Add a variable bootcount to grubenv that increments if
                 upgrade_available is set
                 Add logic in grub.cfg to boot the alternate rootB/A if bootcount
                 reaches 2.

                u-boot uses an upgrade_avaiable flag to update bootcount to reduce

                writes to sd card.


                If upgrade_available=0, u-boot won't bother updating the bootcount

                variable. During HUP, we'll set upgrade_available=1 so that u-boot

                starts counting.


                It'll be the job of the new OS and the rollback services to set

                upgrade_available=0


                For some devices, u-boot will save the bootcount in the boot partition

                in /mnt/boot/bootcount.env. Remove that counter when running hooks

                We move the decision of using either grub legacy or grub EFI from the

                board specific layer to here so that all boards can benefit from these

                changes.


                Additionally, we make it so that this hostapp-update-hook also deletes

                the unnecessary grub.cfg file.

                This is just one example of a package that fails like this. There are

                multiple packages in the cargo source tree that fail with this error.


                The cargo bbclass does a:

                cargo build -v --target x86_64-linux --release


                This has the following effect:

                Updating registry `https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index`


                Updating the registry will result in using the versions pinned upstream.

                In our case, it will be using newer versions of packages that require a

                newer rust version (read_to_string was added in rust 1.26.0). But at the

                (currently meta-rust on sumo branch has rust at version 1.24.1)

                This file allows other components to uniquely parse the information that

                is contained in the changelog. It will be automatically managed by

                versionist by appending the new commits on top. This is needed to

                provide nested-changelogs.
